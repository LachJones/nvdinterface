Building from sources
---------------------

nvdinterface is available `on Github <https://github.com/LachJones/nvdinterface>`_.

You can clone the public repository:

.. code-block::

    $ git clone https://github.com/LachJones/nvdinterface.git

Once you have the source, ensure you have the pre-requisite dependencies. This should occur in a python virtualenvironment (named ``.venv`` in this example) to prevent conflict with other packages on your system.

.. code-block::

    (.venv) $ python -m pip install --upgrade poetry

Then install the recently cloned sources:

.. code-block::

    (.venv) $ cd nvdinterface
    (.venv) $ python -m poetry install
